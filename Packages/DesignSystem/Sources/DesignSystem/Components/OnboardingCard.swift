/// One step of first-run onboarding: an illustration, a title, a sentence, a
/// page indicator and one or two buttons, on an opaque card in the content layer.
///
/// Its three groups (illustration, text, buttons) enter once, 0.10 s apart, when
/// the card first appears, and never again. To move between steps, change the
/// card's values and keep its identity: the picture crossfades, and so does the
/// rest of the step (words, accessory, dots and buttons) as one page; nothing
/// re-enters. The card tells a click from a key press itself: Return presses the
/// primary button too, and then the step changes with no animation. Give the card
/// a new `.id` only to replay the entrance.
///
/// Given every step (`init(steps:…)`), the card is as tall as its tallest step in
/// all of them, so a step change happens in a still frame: a shorter step's words
/// stay at the top and its dots and buttons at the bottom, where every step has
/// them. Given one step, it is as tall as that step.
///
/// An accessory, when a step needs controls of its own (onboarding's samples to
/// choose from), sits under the words and enters with them. Unlike the
/// illustration, which is a picture and hidden from VoiceOver, it is read and
/// can be pressed. A card alone (`stepCount` 1) shows no page dots.
///
/// Each step opens with keyboard focus on the primary button, the one Return
/// presses, so that Space and Return do the same thing until the user tabs away.
/// A disabled card shows no focus, and gives it back to the primary when enabled.
