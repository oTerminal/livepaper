/// Livepaper nowhere, since then quiet is all there is. The sensors (displays, power, lock,

/// The doors to macOS are here too (M7). `WallpaperStore` and `Selection`
/// select Livepaper as the system wallpaper by editing the store, and put the

/// `SMAppService.mainApp`, `Hotkeys` Carbon's `RegisterEventHotKey`.
/// `RotationDriver` moves playlists on from one timer, on wake and once a
/// session (`SessionStart`). `CommandServer` answers the `livepaper` tool on a
/// socket, and `DiagnosticsReport` with `ExtensionLogLines` makes the report
/// Settings copies. Nothing here needs a permission.
