/// `WallpaperEngineScene` behind it, from the programs the import translated
/// (`ScenePrograms`; the translation is `LivepaperImport`'s, since the
/// extension never runs it), our stand-ins for Wallpaper Engine's own
/// textures (`ParticleTextures`), and the scene's sounds (`SceneSoundtrack`).
