/// What the supervisor drives on one surface: a video through `SurfaceLayers`,
/// exactly as before, or a scene through a `SceneEngine` in the tree's Metal
/// slot, chosen by the wallpaper's kind (record 0007).
///
/// A scene holds its poster on the layers, with their decoders released, and is
/// drawn over it; the Metal slot is shown once the scene's first picture is
/// drawn, and hidden only once whatever follows is up. So a switch between a
/// video and a scene is a cut, in either direction, with the poster or the last
/// picture in between and never the neutral colour. Pausing, suspending and
/// the recovery levels mean for a scene what they mean for a video; they come
/// from the same supervisor on the same decisions.
///
/// A scene stopped keeps its last picture in the slot, whatever stopped it: a
/// pause (a pause rule, a display's own, Pause All), a suspend, or a still of
/// that scene (Quit; record 0003), which lets the scene go as a suspend does
/// and puts its poster under the picture for whatever hides the slot later.
/// Shown again, it goes on from the scene time it stopped at, with its
/// picture up throughout.
///
/// On its owner's actor, which in the extension is the main actor, as `SurfaceLayers` is.
