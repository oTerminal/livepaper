/// The layer tree of one surface and the engines on it (`Spikes/results/S5.md`, record 0001).
///
/// The tree (`SurfaceTree`) is made whole in `init`, before the first reply to the agent: a
/// layer added after the agent hosts the context does not composite, so layers are never added
/// or replaced later, and switches and crossfades happen on the two video layers made up front.
///
/// Runs on its owner's actor, which in the extension is the main actor. It is not marked
/// `@MainActor` so that the supervisor's code can drive it through `SurfacePlayback`, but it
/// must stay on the main thread: AVFoundation isolates the video layers to the main actor, and
/// the few calls on them trap anywhere else.
///
/// A request that comes during a crossfade waits for it to end, and the last one wins. A video
/// that cannot be played holds its poster, and a poster that cannot be read shows the neutral colour.
/// Before a surface is let go, `showNothing()`: a renderer must not go while an engine still feeds it.
///
/// Recovery, inside the process:
/// - `.flush`: the engine in front flushes and starts again from a fresh reader.
/// - `.rebuildSurface`: new engines on the same two layers. The old ones are retired at once,
///   even if one is stuck, and never touch the layers again; each new one flushes its layer
///   before it enqueues. The video in front starts again on its layer, keeping its last picture
///   until the new first frame.
/// - `.rebuildPipeline`: everything on the surface built again from the wallpaper: new engines,
///   the poster read again and held while the video starts, the layers laid out afresh.
