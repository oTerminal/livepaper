// The `livepaper` tool (M7). Its arguments become a request
// (`CommandLineRequest`), whose command's `livepaper://` URL goes as one line
// over the app's command socket; the app runs it as it runs every door's
// commands and answers one line of JSON, which is printed: `status` readably
// or with `--json` as the report, `diagnostics` as it is, a refusal on standard
// error. `set <name>` asks for `status` first and resolves the name against it.
// The tool reads and writes no library file, so the app stays the only writer.
// There is no `import`: wallpapers are imported in the app's window alone
// (M7, As built).
//
// It uses the socket, not the URL scheme: LaunchServices reports only that the
// app took a URL, so there would be no reply and no exit code, and an XPC Mach
// service needs a launchd job the app lacks. When no one answers on the socket
// it opens the Livepaper it ships inside (else, run from outside an app, the
// one LaunchServices names for the bundle identifier), without bringing it
// forward, and tries again for a while; with LIVEPAPER_NO_LAUNCH set it leaves
// it closed.
// Exit status: 0 done, 1 refused, 2 usage, 3 unreachable (`CommandLineExit`).
//
// It ships inside the app, at Livepaper.app/Contents/Helpers/livepaper (in
// Contents/MacOS it would collide with the app's `Livepaper` on a
// case-insensitive disk), signed as app.livepaper.cli before the app is sealed.
